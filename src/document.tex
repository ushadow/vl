% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
%\boldmath
We have developed a real-time continuous gesture recognition system that handles two types of gestures seamlessly: 
ones that are characterized by their dynamic paths and ones that are characterized by their static hand poses. 
We design the system based on previous user studies on natural interaction, and
thus are able to address problems that are previously neglected. Our
probabilistic based recognition framework unifies the recognition of the two
types gestures. We use information from the hidden states in the hidden Markov
model to identify the different phases in a gesture: the pre-stroke, the nucleus
and the post-stroke phases. This allows the system to respond appropriately
according different gestures that requre discrete or continuous reponses. Our
system explores more potential with human gestures rather than just making
the hand function as a mouse. We also collected a new gesture data set that
contains the two types of gestures, and propose a new performance metric that
is relevant for evaluating gesture recognition methods for real-time interation.
The system is also extensible. Users can define their own gestures by
giving a few examples rather than writing code. Adding a new gesture only takes
a couple of minutes.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

\section{Gesture Taxonomy for Natural Interaction}
Several gesture taxonomies have been suggested in the literature. Some of them
deal with psychological aspects of gestures \cite{kendon86, mcneill82}, while
some of them deal directly with human computer interaction (HCI) \cite{quek94,
quek95, Pavlovic97}. The taxonomy that seems most appropriate for natural HCI
and human-centric design was developed Wobbrock et al. \cite{wobbrock09}. Their
study is based on eliciting natural behavior from non-technical users when
interacting with a computing system. Although their user study focuses on
tabletop gestures, we believe that the results can be generalized to other
interactive interfaces, e.g., vertical displays. The results from Wobbrock et
al. not only give guidance to gesture set design, but also guidance to the
gesture recognition technology and this is what we are addressing.

Wobbrock et al. classifies gestures in four orthogonal dimensions. As a first
step, we focus on two of them and incorporate them in the designing of the
gesture recognition system and interface. We also further generalize the
taxonomy to encompass interaction for both vertical and horizontal displays.

One dimension is the \textit{form} of a gesture. There are two main categories
in this dimension that are important to distinguish. One category of gestures are characterized
by their distinctive paths but they do not have distinct hand poses. For
example, a \textit{swipe left} gesture is characterized by the right to left motion, and a \textit{circle} gesture is
characterized by the circular motion of the hand. Typically users just
hold their hand in some natural relaxed poses. Another category of gestures are
characterized by their distinctive hand poses but users may move the hand in any
directions, i.e., no distinct paths. For example, a user may use a
\textit{point} hand pose and move around to point at different things on a
display; or a user can use a \textit{palm up} hand pose to signal direct control
of a video and move the hand to fast forward or rewind the video. 

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
Form & distinct path with any hand pose \\
\hline
any path with distinct hand pose \\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Another dimension is the \textit{flow} of a gesture. A gesture's flow is
discrete if the gesture is performed, delimited, recognized, and responded to
as an \textit{event}. An example is the \textit{wave} gesture which has a few
repetitions of left and right movement and usually we want the system to respond
at the last repetition. Flow is continuous if ongoing recognition is required
and the system should respond frame by frame, such as during the
\textit{pointing} gesture, we want to show the cursor on the screen continuously
move according to the hand position. Hence, the flow of the gesture affects how
the system should respond and this can be a choice at the application level. For
the same gesture, the application can choose to respond in a continuous or
discrete manner. 

\subsection{Temporal Modeling of Gestures}
To build a real-time interactive system, it is important to have a responsive
system that respond to users' gesture input appropriately according the flow of
the gesture. As a result, it is important to consider the temporal
characteristics of gestures.

It has been established that three phases make a gesture:
\begin{itemize}
  \item pre-stroke,
  \item nucleus (peak \cite{mcneill82}), and
  \item post-stroke \cite{Pavlovic97}.
\end{itemize}
The three temporal phases are distinguishable through the general hand/arm
motion: ``pre-stroke'' and ``post-stroke'' are movement from and to the
rest position, characterized by the rapid change in the position of the hand.
The ``nucleus'', in general, exhibits relatively slower hand motion. The ``nucleus'' of a gesture,
as Kendon \cite{kendon86} observes, has some ``definite form and enhanced dynamic
qualities''. Every gesture must have a ``nucleus'', which is considered by
Kendon to be the content-carrying part of the gesture. Based on this theory, we
expect that the lack of the ``nucleus'' part is how unintentional movements can
be distinguished from gestures. 

Since ``nucleus'' is the meaningful part of the gesture, for a discrete flow
gesture, we want the system to respond immediately at the end of the ``nucleus''
phase instead of at the end of the ``post-stroke'' phase which can be more
easily detected by finding the start of the rest position. However, in order to
make the system more responsive, we address the more challenging problem of
detecting the start and end of the ``nucleus'' phase from the ``pre-stroke''
and ``post-stroke'' phases. This allows the system to respond to continuous flow
gesture immediately at the start of the ``nucleus'' phase and to discrete flow
gesture at the end of the ``nucleus'' phase.

\section{Related Work}

\section{Implications for Gesture Recognition Technology}

\section{Hand Tracking and Feature Extraction}
As one form of the gestures are characterized by their distinct hand poses, we
need to track the full hand, rather than just treating the hand as one point. We
also need to derive a feature vector that represents the hand shape as well.

We choose to use the Kinect sensor because we can derive hand shape features
from the depth or RGB data. The skeleton tracking from the Kinect SDK is
relative robust for standing articulated body poses. At each time frame, we use
the hand joint position reported from the SDK to find the initial rough estimation of the
bounding box of the hand in the depth frame. Then we use skin detection to
filter out non-skin pixels in the bounding box after aligning the RGB and the
depth frames, and refine the bounding box using 4 interactions of CAMSHIFT
\cite{bradski98}. We normalize the bounding box to a $64\times 64$ px depth
mapped image. Histogram of oriented gradients (HOGs) \cite{dalal05} is computed from
the normalized hand image (cell size = 4, number of orientation bins = 9). We
only use one fold of normalization to speed up processing and since the depth
data is not affected significantly by lighting conditions. The HOG feature has
been used as a hand pose descriptor in previous works \cite{song12} where they
are often used as the input to a classifier such as Support Vector Machine
(SVM). Here, after applying principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the
dimensionality from 441 to 14, we use it directly as part of the input feature
vector to the hidden Markov model (HMM) based recognition framework.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically

% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
