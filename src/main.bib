	Abstract = {The authors introduce a fast and robust method for tracking a user's hands and multiple fingertips. They then demonstrate gesture recognition based on measured fingertip trajectories for augmented desk interface systems. This tracking method is capable of tracking multiple fingertips in a reliable manner even in a complex background under a dynamically changing lighting condition without any markers. The authors' gesture recognition system is particularly advantageous for human-computer interaction (HCI) in that users can achieve interactions based on symbolic gestures at the same time that they perform direct manipulation with their own hands and fingers.},
